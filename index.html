      <h1 style="color: green; margin-top: 4rem;">Godfather ipsum dolor sit amet. Mr Corleone is Johnny Fontane's godfather. Now Italians regard that as a very close, a very sacred religious relationship. That's my family Kay, that's not me. What's the matter with you? Is this what you've become, a Hollywood finocchio who cries like a woman? "Oh, what do I do? What do I do?" What is that nonsense? Ridiculous! If anything in this life is certain, if history has taught us anything, it is that you can kill anyone.

It's not personal. It's business. Leave the gun. Take the cannoli. My father is no different than any powerful man, any man with power, like a president or senator. Vito, how do you like my little angel? Isn't she beautiful? My father taught me many things here - he taught me in this room. He taught me: keep your friends close, but your enemies closer.
