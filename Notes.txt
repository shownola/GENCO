How would you link to a different page instead of linking to a section of the same page?
By changin <a href> link from "#features"(fo example) to "features.html" so long as there is a filed called 'fetaures.html' to link to
  Correct! If you link to a new page you will also need to add an "active" class to the <a> tag to highlight the menu link color. You would also remove Bootstrap Scrollspy from the <body> tag.
